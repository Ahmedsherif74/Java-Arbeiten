Java DataTypes :

String : A data Type to store text in " "

byte : to store an intger -128 to 127

short : to store numbers from -32,768 to 32,767

int : to store numbers // -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

long : to store numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

float : to store numbers with decimals like 1.5f //  Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits

double : to store decimals Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits   should end with d

char : to store only single character // char myVar1 = 65  sout myVar1 will print the ASCII code of this number

boolean : to store either true or false //true or false

How to declare more than one variable in just one line :

int x , y , z ;

x = bew ;

and so on



TypeCasting :

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

    int myInt = 9;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

    double myDouble = 9.78d;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int


Operations :

+ - * / % ++ --


Assignment operations :

x +=3 // Means x=x+3

x -=3 // Means x=x-3

x *=3 // Means x=x*3


Comparison Operatots :

== // If the two items are equal

!= // If the two items are not equal

> // first greater than 2nd

< // 2nd greater than first

>= // Greater than or equal to

<= // Less than or equal to
